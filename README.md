### Hi! I'm Kristian

I'm a cloud / devops engineering manager. I currently lead a team of wicked good engineers. We work on lots of entertaining projects helping our keep our systems secure and performant for our customers and our development teams. 

My days at work are challenging helping my team solve technical problems, and make plans for the future of our cloud environment. The top of mind for me these days is how companies (small and large) plan and deploy their cloud infrastructure, and what they should think about before they even press that shiny Create An AWS Account button.
