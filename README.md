### Hi! I'm Kristian

I'm a cloud / devops engineering manager. I currently lead a team of wicked good engineers. We work on lots of entertaining projects helping our keep our systems top notch for all of our development teams. 

My days at work are challenging helping my team solve technical problems, and make plans for the future of our cloud environment. I don't get to play with the deeply technical tech as much as I like during the day so here I am in the evenings, working on Open Source projects in my spare time.

The top of mind for me these days is how companies (small and large) plan and deploy their cloud infrastructure. I have started an Open Source project here on Github to walk newcomers through configuring their first AWS cloud deployment and what they should think about before they even press that shiny Create An AWS Account button.
